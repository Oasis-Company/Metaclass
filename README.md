## What Is Metaclass?

Metaclass is not a programming construct.

Metaclass is a formal system for defining digital existence through constraint geometry.

It replaces traditional class-based ontology with a continuous, constraint-driven model of being.  
In this system, entities are not instances of types — they are stable regions within a high-dimensional constraint space.

Metaclass defines the axioms for that space.

## Why Metaclass?

Modern digital systems rely on discrete type hierarchies:

- class → subclass → instance  
- schema → object  
- template → implementation  

Reality does not behave this way.

Reality is:

- continuous  
- constraint-bound  
- dynamically stable  
- locally self-consistent  

Metaclass introduces a new foundation:

> Existence is a stable solution within a constraint field.

## Core Principles

### 1. Existence Is Not a Type

An entity is not a member of a class.

An entity is a point or region in a multi-axis constraint space.

---

### 2. Axis (Foundational Dimensions)

Axis define the dimensions of possible existence.

Examples:

- Rigidity
- Continuity
- Compressibility
- Thermal State
- Spatial Cohesion
- Causality

Each Axis defines:

- Domain
- Metric
- Constraint rules

Axis are not properties of objects.  
They are coordinates of the ontological space.

### 3. Constraint Bundles

A Metaclass is a Constraint Bundle.

It defines a stable region in ontological space.
