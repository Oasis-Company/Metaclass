# Metaclass Documentation

## Overview

Metaclass is a formal system for defining digital existence through constraint geometry. It replaces traditional class-based ontology with a continuous, constraint-driven model of being.

In this system, entities are not instances of types — they are stable regions within a high-dimensional constraint space. Metaclass defines the axioms for that space.

## Documentation Structure

- **installation-guide.md**: Instructions for setting up the Metaclass system
- **usage-guide.md**: How to use Metaclass in your projects
- **api-reference.md**: Detailed API documentation

## Core Concepts

- **Axis**: Foundational dimensions of existence (e.g., Continuity, Rigidity, Causality)
- **Constraint Bundle**: A set of constraints that define a stable region in the constraint space
- **Stability**: A valid existence must be stable (constraints must converge)
- **Projection**: Mapping from constraint space to operational domains (physics, rendering, AI)

## System Architecture

Metaclass is composed of:

1. **Axis Registry**: Defines foundational ontological dimensions
2. **Constraint Algebra**: Defines how constraints combine, intersect, and conflict
3. **Stability Solver**: Determines whether a constraint configuration is self-consistent
4. **Projection Operators**: Maps constraint space into physics, rendering, or AI systems
